            'Purpose, Scope, & Limitations of an Inspection': 'Thank you very much for choosing us to perform your property inspection. The purpose of this inspection is to determine the systems and components used, and their apparent condition. To get started, let us be clear on the scope, limitations, and use of this report.  The inspection company, inspectors, and staff have no personal interest, present or prospective, in this property, in the parties to the sale or proceeds of the mortgage, and have no identity-of-interest or conflict-of interest with the borrower, seller, lender, realtor, appraiser, plan reviewer, any potential contractors, or subcontractors.  No portion of this property or any specific system or component was inspected for code compliance, or surveyed, appraised, or assessed for boundaries, values, or taxation purposes. The reported portions of this property were inspected ONLY for minimum general acceptability requirements of health and safety in accordance with all applicable state and federal requirements.  The report and the inspection itself comply with the requirements of the Standards of Practice and Code of Ethics of our national association, all applicable state and federal requirements, as well as those of Fidelity Building Inspections, LLC. The “standards” define what is and what is not included in the inspection. We recommend referencing the standards to avoid unrealistic expectations, and to better understand the focus of a property inspection.  The inspection, the report, photographs, and all associated documentation and/or commentary are copyrighted, and may not be used in whole or in part without our express written permission. These have been prepared for the exclusive use of our client. No use by third parties is intended. We will not be responsible to any other parties for the contents of the report.  Visual observations made on a certain day will differ and eventually become obsolete as conditions change. Seasonal variations will also alter the observable conditions of a property. The inspection is a faithful, though limited “snapshot” in time. After immediate repairs have been made, we recommend scheduling regular follow-up home inspections at minimum four-year intervals to discover new indications of potentially progressing concerns in order to keep your investment in top condition.  We are pleased to have been of service to you, and would welcome your referral of friends, associates, or others who could also benefit from our services. Feel free to contact us with any questions, or comments.  Again, thanks for choosing us to perform your inspection. We look forward to working with you in the years ahead. Sincerely, Rod Beacham, ACI on behalf of Fidelity Building Inspections, LLC',
