The material used to produce “asbestos-cement” (Portland cement reinforced with asbestos fibers) was originally created in 1905 as a coating for boilers, steam pipes, and equipment that generated heat.   In the 1920s siding boards were produced with smooth surfaces, and by 1937 textured finishes including wood-grain patterns installed as long planks, were available, and came pre-drilled for nailing.  .  Although the EPA does not consider asbestos-cement products to be friable (easily crumbled or reduced to powder) because the cement acts as a binder, cutting asbestos-cement siding during installation, drilling or deterioration may release asbestos fibers and/or silica dust. Asbestos-cement siding is vulnerable to impact damage and must be painted regularly."

EIFS cladding is also called “synthetic stucco.”  EIFS resembles the look of hard-coat stucco, but unlike stucco, is NOT breathable.   Interior moisture has difficulty exiting through exterior walls, and may become trapped in the exterior wall framing, causing rot and deterioration of the structural envelope.  Prior to January 1, 1996, manufacturers of EIFS products failed to require adequate structural protection, or to require a drainage & ventilation space behind the cladding for interior moisture to escape.  As a result, excessive damages resulting from the inadequate installation of EIFS claddings on many homes built before 1996 prompted some insurance companies to refuse coverage on homes with EFIS cladding.  Recommend further evaluation by EIFS professionals to determine best course of action."

         "value": "Portions of the exterior cladding were brick veneer.  Brick exteriors are generally durable, and resistant to mechanical impact.  Brick, like all masonry products, is susceptible to moisture saturation, and all brick veneer cladding installed since the 1970s should have the necessary drainage channel and “weep holes” to avoid trapping moisture behind the veneer."

         "title": "Hard Coat Stucco",
         "value": "Portions of the exterior cladding were stucco.  True “hard-coat” stucco cladding also known as “Portland” cement plaster, is a time tested and durable exterior breathable finish, and has been used successfully since its’ invention in Portland, England in 1824.  Hard coat stucco is applied either by hand or machine to wall surfaces in two or three coats.  It may be applied directly (integrally bonded) to solid masonry surfaces, or over a vapor-permeable, water resistant building paper applied to metal lath, attached to wood framing.  Hard coat stucco sheds but does not trap water, and is highly resistant to impact."

         "title": "Man-made Stone",
         "value": "Portions of the exterior cladding were manufactured stone.  Over the years, several different types of exterior stone surfaces have been used.  Some of the most recent man-made stone products, created to assimilate the look of real stone, may trap moisture against the wall sheathing, unless adequate provision is made for air circulation and drainage.  Recommend re-evaluation and remediation if needed."

         "title": "EIFS",
         "value": "Portions of the exterior cladding were EIFS (Exterior Insulated Finishing System) or commonly called “synthetic stucco.”  EIFS resembles the look of hard-coat stucco, but although durable, is less resistant to impact damage.  Unlike stucco, the weathertight cladding surface is NOT breathable (interior moisture has difficulty exiting through exterior walls).   EIFS suffered a major set-back when it became apparent that the EIFS surface was trapping moisture inside the exterior wall envelope, causing rot and deterioration of the framing components.  Beginning January 1, 1996, most manufacturers of EIFS products began requiring installers to provide adequate moisture protection for the structure, and a drainage & ventilation space behind the cladding to allow moisture to escape.  Recommend further evaluation by EIFS professionals to verify adequate installation and to assess condition."

         "title": "Wood Cladding",
         "value": "Portions of the exterior cladding were wood siding.  Wood siding is completely natural, resistant to impact, and until the 1920s was the predominant siding material in the nation.   Wood siding is more susceptible to insect damage, may deteriorate over time, and can be more expensive than many alternate sidings.  To avoid damages from wicking, wood must be adequately separated from roof surfaces, patios, drives or walkways.  End grains are particularly vulnerable to moisture intrusion, and flashing is used at exposed exterior wood and all fenestrations (doors, windows, decks, etc).  Wood siding requires a protective coating (stain or paint) to be applied and refreshed at frequent intervals (typically every three to five years.  Unprotected siding may split, warp, curl, cup, crack, or check."

         "title": "T-111 Cladding",
         "value": "Portions of the exterior cladding were T-111 siding.  T-111 is a high-heat processed product (similar to plywood) and is usually installed in large sheets with or without vertical grooves.   T-111 is composed of several layers of wood, and is susceptible to wicking up moisture, and warping or cupping where inadequately secured to the wall.  On taller walls or gable ends, the horizontal joints between upper and lower sheets should be flashed to prevent moisture intrusion."

         "title": "Hardi Siding",
         "value": "Portions of the exterior cladding were fiber-cement siding (Hardi or similar).  Fiber-cement siding is composed of cement, pulp fiber, sand, and special additives, and is manufactured as a smooth sheet and then embossed with a wood grain or stucco finish.  Fiber-cement has the look of real wood, but is impervious to rot, swelling, warpage, or wood-boring insects.  Fiber-cement siding needs to be painted regularly, although less frequently than wood siding.   Deterioration of fiber-cement siding, or cutting or drilling during installation, may release silica dust."

         "title": "Metal (Aluminum or Steel)",
         "value": "Portions of the exterior cladding were metal siding.  Between the 1940s to the 1970s, various types of metal siding have been used.  Metal siding provides easy maintenance.  Aluminum siding is lightweight and easier to install, but dents easier that does steel siding.  Steel siding is heavier for installers to work with, and is susceptible to rusting if the steel becomes exposed (scratched paint).  Metal cladding conducts electricity, and should be separated from electrical cables."

         "title": "Vinyl",
         "value": "Portions of the exterior cladding were vinyl siding.  Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), also called ” vinyl “ siding was first used as a siding material in the late 1950s.   Most pre-1970s vinyl siding had problems with expansion and contraction, discoloration, and brittleness.  Vinyl siding does not conduct or transfer electricity, and does not rust, pit, peel, or corrode.  Vinyl siding is easy installation, low maintenance (doesn’t need scraping or painting), and siding color in newer vinyl permeates the siding panel, so scratches don’t show.  All vinyl siding materials are more vulnerable to impact during cold temperatures."

         "title": "Asphalt Cladding",
         "value": "Portions of the exterior cladding were asphalt siding.  During the 1940s and early 1950s, before vinyl and polyurethane alternatives became available, asphalt siding was used extensively in low-cost development homes.  The original asphalt siding was a heavy felt-like material coated with thick asphalt and crushed mineral granules, much like asphalt roofing shingles today, and came in a range of styles including imitation brick and stone.  Asphalt Siding did not shatter like fiber cement, resisted weathering, and was less expensive than brick or stone.  Some asphalt sidings contain asbestos fibers, and over time most asphalt siding panels were shown to cup, pull away, loosen, or fall off."

The static water pressure of this home at hose bib level (48 psi) appeared to be near the low end of what is typically recommended.  And predictably, water pressure decreases at upper levels.  If a higher flow rate is available from the source, and the in-line pressure regulator is simply set too low, then adjustment may help increase the pressure.

Excessive water pressure may contribute to dripping faucets and premature faucet failure.  In most cases, the installation or re-adjustment of an in-line pressure regulator can alleviate higher water pressure concerns.  Recommend further evaluation and improvements as needed."
