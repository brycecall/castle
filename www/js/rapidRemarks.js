Proper slope (eliminating negative grade) helps prevent moisture intrusion issues."},
    "2": "All earth or foliage to wood contact should be eliminated, and adequate separation should be maintained to prevent pest or moisture concerns, and to allow adequate space for service / maintenance work.  (Adequate separation minimums are roughly 6 to 8 inch to soil, and 10 to 12 inch to vegetation).",
    "3": "There was evidence of significantly damaged or deteriorated exterior cladding (siding and trim), and/or deck components, ie; swollen, bulging, stained, or deteriorated, with fungal rot (probed) at some boards.  Recommend re-evaluation of all exposed exterior wood components (cladding, trim, fascia, soffit, posts, stairs, decks, railings), and corrections made as necessary.",
    "4": "One or more retaining walls showed large cracks, holes, gaps, or other evidence of movement, settling or mechanical damage.  Recommend re-evaluation and remediation.",
    "5": "The retaining walls appeared to be leaning, or out of plumb.  Significant leaning is an indicator of excessive pressure, and should be re-evaluated prior to failure.",
    "6": "There was evidence of inadequate drainage from the retaining wall (stains, leaking water, silt deposits, or other drainage concerns).    Recommend re-evaluation and corrections as necessary.",
    "7": "The yard appeared to have inadequate slope and/or drainage to carry water away from the property.  Standing surface water can contribute to harmful pests and wood-destroying insects or organisms (WDI & WDO).  Also, during wet seasons, water retention may cause unsafe or slippery walking surfaces.s",
